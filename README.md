# Bill Ni

Welcome to my GitHub!

Some things about me:
 - My IDE setup: Sublime Text + Terminal
 - Goto language: Python3
 - My website: [billni.com](https://billni.com)
 
Stuff I hate:
 - Languages that mandate semicolons :tired_face: (are newlines not good enough for your compiler?)
 - Messy websites

Stuff I love:
 - Arizona Iced Tea
 - Code comments
 - Database schemas that actually make sense :sob: (if you have lists in a row, please don't use a relational database)
 
Resume hacks:
 - If you're in Google Docs/Microsoft Word, use a table without borders or padding to clean up row spacing
 - Make your margins 0.5 inch to fit more stuff
 - Try to make bullet points take up the whole line and try not to go over by one or two words
